# Notes

## Lesson 9: NaN & Infinity

There is a NaN value, Infinity, -Infinity, 0 and -0

## Lesson 12: Unary Operators

```
let counter
counter = counter + 1;
counter += 1;
counter ++;
```

## Lesson 18: String indices

```
let song = "Surfin USA"
song[0] = "D"
song --> "Surfin USA"
```

strings in js are immutable, meaning u can't change one character of a string at a time

## Lesson 22: String escape characters

string escapes
```
\n - newline
\' - single quote
\" - double quote
\\ - backlash
```

## Lesson 23: String template literals

Template literals are strings that allow embedded expressions, which will be evaluated and then turned into a resulting string.
```
`I counted ${3 + 4} sheep`. // "I counted 7 sheep"
```

must use backtick characters for string literals

{} = interpolating data

```
`You brought ${quantity} ${item} total price: $${price*quantity}`
```

double $$ is cuz the inner most is for the math operation and the outer most $ is for the number to be placed into the string

## Lesson 32: Running code from a script

Chrome console is called a REPL - Read, evaluate, print, loop
