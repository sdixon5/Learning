## Lesson 4: Introducting Components

The building blocks of react

Pieces of UI & view logic

Classes that know how to render themselves into HTML

There are also function components

## Lesson 7: Writing our First Components

Class Components

    The Traditional React Component
    Write Logic in a JS Class
    Must include a render method


Bable takes jsx and turns it into js

Inside of the render return you can only return one thing, one element

## Lesson 8: Function vs Class Components

Function Components

    Historically used for simpler "dumb" components
    Write logic in a JS function
    No render method needed, just return content


What's the difference?

    Both can accept props and render content

    Historically, function components couldn't use important features like:
        State
        
        Lifecycle methods
    
    With the introduction of Hooks, we can now write full-featured function components

    This course covers hooks!


Our Approach

    We'll begin working with mainly class components

    That way you only have to worry about one syntax at first

    Later in the course we learn Hooks and mainly write function components
