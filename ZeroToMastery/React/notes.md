NPM downloads down the create-react-app tool, then we use it to create our app

`npm install create-react-app monsters-rolodex`

`npm list <package name>`

`NPM list -g <package name>`

NPX installs and executes the package, then deletes it immediately

`npx install create-react-app monsters-rolodex`
