# JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures

## Section 1: Introduction

Discusses all topics covered and best order to watch everything in. Boils down to each section has a list of pre-reqs, watch/learn those before moving on.

### How he runs his code:

All in browser.
No downloads.

## Section 2: Big O Notation

Contains math!

- Motivate the need for big o
- What is it?

  A way to compare code and determine which one is "best". We can assign generalized labels to each algorithm.

  It is a way to talk about how code compares to another.

  A way to talk about trade-offs

  Is useful to debug code.

  And ofcourse, it comes up in interviews!

- Simplify expressions
- Define "time complexity" and "space complexity"
- Evaluate the time and space complexity of different algorithms
- What is a logarithm?

Addition example has a slide with the math behind how the n(n+1)/2 alorigthm was made.

What does better mean?

- Faster? (we will focus on this)
- less memory usage?
- more readable?
- less characters?

The problem with time

- diff machines record diff time
- same machine will record diff time
- fast algorithms, speed measurement not precise enough
